\subsubsection*{Generating delta-MVLN Kobe posteriors}

Generate Kobe posteriors from a MVLN distribution requires the means and the variance-covariance matrix (VCM) of $log(SSB/SSB_{MSY})$ and $log(F/F_{MSY})$. Let $u = SSB/SSB_{MSY}$ and $v = F/F_{MSY}$  and $x = log(u)$ and $y = log(v)$ , then the $VCM$ has the form:
    			
\begin{equation}
VCM_{x,y} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2_x & cov_{x,y}  \\
cov_{x,y} & \sigma^2_y
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}

where  is the variance of x,  is the covariance of y and  is the covariance of x and y.  The quantities that can be directly extracted from Stock Synthesis are: (1) MLEs, asymptotic standard errors (SE) and correlation of $SSB/SSB_{MSY}$  and $F/F_{MSY}$. 
The construction of the  therefore requires to conduct a few normal to lognormal transformations. First, we approximate  and  as:

\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_x = \disp log\left(1+\left(\frac{SE_u}{u}\right)^2\right)  
\quad 
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_x = \disp log\left(1+\left(\frac{SE_v}{v}\right)^2\right)  
\quad 
\end{equation}

where  and  is the asymptotic standard error estimate for $u = SSB/SSB_{MSY}$ and $v = F/F_{MSY}$. Second, the covariance of x and y can then be approximated on log-scale by:

\begin{equation}
COV_{x,y} = \disp log \right{1+ \rho_{u,v} \sqrt{\sigma^2_x\sigma^2_y}\right \quad 
\end{equation}

where  donates the correlation of u and v.
To generate the desired KPD for $SSB/SSB_{MSY}$  and $F/F_{MSY}$, we use a multivariate random generator, available in the R package ‘mvtnorm’, to obtain a large number (nsim = 10,000) of x and y pairs, such that

\begin{equation}
kobe_{x,y} = \disp MVN{\mu_{x,y},VCM_{x,y}) 
\quad 
\end{equation}

where  is the vector of the MLEs x and y. The joint MVLN distribution of $-SSB/SSB_{MSY}$  and $-F/F_{MSY}$ is then obtained as the exponential of $kone_{x,y}$.
